This page lists out the setup guides for the tools used in class.

All you need for this class is a text editor and a modern browser. I will be using VSCode and Chrome (Firefox has been laggy lately with WebGL for some reason), however feel free to use whichever WebGL-enabled browser you wish. If you are looking for a modern IDE that supports JavaScript, consider VSCode, JetBrains (should be free via student educational discount), or Brackets.

## Local tools

### `gcloud`

### `functions framework`
