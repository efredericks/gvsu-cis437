This page lists out the setup guides for the tools used in class.

All you need for this class is a text editor and a modern browser. I will be using VSCode and Chrome (Firefox has been laggy lately with WebGL for some reason), however feel free to use whichever WebGL-enabled browser you wish. If you are looking for a modern IDE that supports JavaScript, consider VSCode, JetBrains (should be free via student educational discount), or Brackets.

## Cloud Accounts

We will primarily be using Google Cloud in this course as they provide the most optimal path to free credits for students.

One point to keep in mind:

<h1><b>NEVER PUT YOUR CREDIT CARD INTO ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS!</b></h1>

You do not want to be charged for anything you do here - I can get you additional credits if you run out!  You just need to **contact me** when you are running low.


## Local tools

### `gcloud`

### `functions framework`
